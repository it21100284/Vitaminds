Nutrition Web App - Group No 14-ITPM



Good Health and Well-being" is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. The goal aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages. Nutrition web apps have become increasingly popular in recent years as a tool for promoting healthy eating habits and improving nutritional status. However, many existing apps suffer from usability and accessibility issues, making it difficult for users with disabilities or limited technological literacy to engage with them.This research paper aims to design a user-friendly and accessible nutrition web app that can effectively support users in making healthy food choices based on their dietary habits and nutritional status.   The results of the study demonstrate that a user-friendly and accessible nutrition web app can effectively support users in making healthy food choices, regardless of their technological literacy or disability status. The app's recipe recoomendations personalization and meal planning features were particularly effective in helping users make healthier food choices. In addition to incorporating personalized meal planning and recipe recommendations based on users' dietary habits and nutritional status, the nutrition web app also features advanced tools for tracking and analyzing daily nutrition data. These tools include Body Mass Index (BMI) and calorie counters, which allow users to easily monitor and manage their daily intake of essential nutrients and calories. The inclusion of these advanced tracking and analysis features enhances the app's ability to support users in making informed and healthy food choices, thereby improving their overall nutritional status and well-being.The findings of this research paper can inform the design of future nutrition web apps and contribute to the promotion of healthy eating habits and improved nutritional status for all.
